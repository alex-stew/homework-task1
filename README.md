Code Refactoring Assignment

This project is a code refactoring task whereby we are required to take an existing piece of source code and 'clean it up' without changing any of the functionality of the website. On researching refactoring it is clear that within the community an important aspect of coding, is the "boy scout rule' - where you aim to leave the code (campsite in the analogy) cleaner than you found it. 

I begin the task by first understanding the objective, which is to ensure that the HTML and CSS files are organised and implemented with convention in mind. Semantic tags should be used to make certain that the code is easy to read and that another coder could understand the flow and purpose of the elements included. Another objective of this project is to apply the correct accessibility features to the code so that people with visual impairments can use page readers efficiently to convey the information to them.
