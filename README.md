Code Refactoring Assignment

This project is a code refactoring task whereby we are required to take an existing piece of source code and 'clean it up' without changing any of the functionality of the website. On researching refactoring it is clear that within the community an important aspect of coding, is the "boy scout rule' - where you aim to leave the code (campsite in the analogy) cleaner than you found it.

I begin the task by first understanding the objective, which is to ensure that the HTML and CSS files are organised and implemented with convention in mind. Semantic tags should be used to make certain that the code is easy to read and that another coder could understand the flow and purpose of the elements included. Another objective of this project is to apply the correct accessibility features to the code so that people with visual impairments can use page readers efficiently to convey the information to them. Additionally, these tags assist with search engine optimisation with sites like google which improves the companies ability to be found through, for example, a Google search.

In particular, the most difficult issue I encountered was moving the .hero class background img from the CSS to then apply the correct accessibility alt tags on the HTML side, without breaking the aesthetic of the site where the img imports across far too large. Remembering to git add and commit along the way was also a difficulty I encountered, as I would regularly push on with changes as I saw them without taking the time to manage version control along the way.
